# Descriptive-Analysis-on-Diabetes-Data

## Overview

This project focuses on performing a descriptive analysis on a diabetes dataset using Python. The dataset contains information about individuals, including features such as age, Pregnancies, Glucosw, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Outcome, and diabetes progression measurements. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, understand its distribution, and extract key statistical information.

Descriptive analysis plays a fundamental role in data exploration, helping to identify trends, outliers, and important relationships within the data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `APALABDA1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code and detailed analysis.
- `diabetes_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for analysis in CSV format.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook and perform the analysis, you will need the following:

- Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
- Jupyter Notebook: Install Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis interactively.
- Required Python libraries: Make sure you have essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed. You can install them using pip:
